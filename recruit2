🎤 SCREEN Company Introduction + Your Role + Wafer Cleaning Overview

(For NAIST Career Fair – Q&A Session)

⸻

1️⃣ About SCREEN and Our Business

“SCREEN Semiconductor Solutions is one of the global leaders in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.
We are especially known for our wafer cleaning systems — and in fact, we have the top global market share in batch-type wet cleaning equipment.

Our tools are used by many world-class fabs, including TSMC, Intel, Micron, and others.
Because of that, we work on a variety of international projects, customizing our systems for each customer’s specific process flow and requirements.”

2️⃣ Importance of Cleaning in Semiconductor Manufacturing

“Cleaning is one of the most important steps in semiconductor fabrication.

During the process — deposition, photolithography, etching, and CMP — tiny particles or chemical residues remain on the wafer surface.
If we don’t remove them completely, they can cause defects in the next step and reduce yield.

That’s why wet cleaning is repeated many times throughout the entire process. For example:
• After deposition, we remove film debris and chemical residues.
• After photolithography, we remove photoresist and organic residues.
• After etching, we remove metal ions and etch by-products.
• After CMP, we remove slurry particles and metallic contamination.

So cleaning is not just one step — it is repeated many times to keep the wafer surface perfectly clean.”

3️⃣ Your Role in Control System Development

“I work as a control system engineer for the FC3000 batch-type cleaning equipment.

The control software consists of four main parts — GUI, scheduler, transfer, and tank control.
I’m in charge of the chemical treatment tank software.

Each system is customized for every customer. For example, some fabs require additional functions like a side spray system in the tank.
The customer interface team proposes the idea, and we discuss with them about software feasibility and implementation.

Since I’m still a new engineer, I mainly focus on learning — attending design meetings, running simulations to study machine operation, and analyzing error logs to understand the system behavior.
I look at the related code, design documents, and machine data to find the root cause of issues.
It’s challenging but very interesting to see how hardware and software work together in a real machine.”

4️⃣ Closing Message for Students

“Working at SCREEN gives us the opportunity to be part of world-class semiconductor projects and to see our software actually control real equipment used in fabs around the world.

If you are interested in both programming and hardware, this kind of work can be very rewarding.”
