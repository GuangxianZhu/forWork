非常好 👍
你提前准备这个非常关键。NAIST 的学生（尤其是信息科学/材料/电子系）通常会在 Q&A 环节问一些带技术含义、但也想了解公司文化和职业发展的混合性问题。

下面是我帮你整理的

🎯 「NAIST 学生可能会问的问题 + 你可以准备的英文回答思路」
分为 5 大类：技术类、工作内容类、职业发展类、文化与语言类、实习/求职类。

💻 1️⃣ 技术类（Technical Questions）

学生可能问	回答要点关键词
What kind of programming languages or technologies do you use?	“Mainly C and C++ for control logic. Sometimes C# or Python for GUI or testing tools.”
What type of control system or architecture do you use?	“It’s an embedded control system managing sensors, valves, motors through RS-485 and PLC interfaces.”
How do you test or debug the system?	“We use both simulators and real equipment for verification. The simulator helps us test logic safely before running the machine.”
How do you ensure reliability and safety in such complex machines?	“We have interlock and error handling functions to prevent unsafe operations.”
Do you use any AI or data analysis in cleaning systems?	“Not directly in control software, but data analysis and optimization are becoming more important for predictive maintenance.”
What’s the difference between batch-type and single-wafer cleaning?	“Batch type cleans many wafers at once — higher throughput and efficiency. Single-wafer focuses on process precision.”

🧑‍💼 2️⃣ 工作内容类（Your Role & Daily Work）

学生可能问	回答思路
What exactly do you do in your daily work?	“Mainly design discussions, running simulations, studying system behavior, and analyzing errors.”
What’s the most difficult part of your job?	“Understanding the whole system — both software and mechanical aspects — because everything is connected.”
What’s the most interesting part?	“Seeing how my software actually controls real chemical systems in production equipment.”
How big is your team?	“In our control software section, each group focuses on one function such as GUI or tank. We collaborate closely.”
Do you write the code yourself?	“Not yet for big features — I’m still learning, but I’m reading and debugging real production code.”

📈 3️⃣ 职业发展类（Career & Learning）

学生可能问	回答要点关键词
How can students prepare for this type of job?	“Study C/C++, control theory, and communication protocols. Understanding hardware helps a lot.”
Are there training programs for new engineers?	“Yes, we have several months of technical and on-site training, plus mentor support.”
Is there a chance to move between divisions, like process or design?	“Yes, depending on your interest and skills — SCREEN has many development groups.”
How do you feel working in a big company like SCREEN?	“There’s a lot to learn, and many experienced engineers to guide you.”
What do you want to achieve in the future?	“To design reliable control functions that can be used by customers worldwide.”

学生可能问	回答思路
Do you use English in your work?	“Yes, for manuals, design documents, and sometimes for overseas customers.”
How is teamwork at SCREEN?	“We often work in cross-functional teams — software, electrical, and process engineers together.”
How is the working environment for non-Japanese employees?	“Quite supportive — communication is mostly in Japanese, but many people are patient and helpful.”
Is overtime common?	“It depends on the project phase, but generally it’s well managed.”
Do you work remotely?	“Sometimes possible, but for debugging we need to be at the site or lab.”

🎓 5️⃣ 实习 / 求职类（Recruitment / Internship）

学生可能问	回答思路
What kind of students are you looking for?	“Those who are curious, like solving problems, and can think logically.”
Is internship available for international students?	“Yes, sometimes — it depends on the year and project.”
Do I need to know Japanese to work at SCREEN?	“Japanese helps a lot for communication, but technical skills and motivation are more important.”
How is the interview process?	“Usually document screening, technical interview, and communication check.”
